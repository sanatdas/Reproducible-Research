THe Dataset: subset of a United States medical expenditures dataset with information on costs for different medical conditions and in different areas of the country.

## Objective
To analyze the following by exploring the relationship between variables

* what is the relationship between mean covered charges (Average.Covered.Charges) and mean total payments (Average.Total.Payments) in New York?

* how does the relationship between mean covered charges (Average.Covered.Charges) and mean total payments (Average.Total.Payments) vary by medical condition (DRG.Definition) and the state in which care was received (Provider.State)?

Constraint: Use only the base R graphics system (not ggplot2 or lattice) to make your figure.
